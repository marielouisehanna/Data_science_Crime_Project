## Project Overview üîç
Welcome to the **Data Science Crime Project**! This project explores crime data, aiming to identify trends, patterns, and insights into criminal activities. The goal is to leverage data science techniques to analyze and potentially predict crime occurrences, providing valuable insights for public safety and crime prevention.

## Dataset üìä
The dataset used in this project contains details of various cyber incidents affecting organizations, including:

- **Company**: Name of the affected organization.
- **Year**: Year in which the incident occurred.
- **Records**: Number of records compromised in the breach.
- **Organization_type**: The sector of the organization affected (e.g., Healthcare, Tech, Web).
- **Method**: Cause of the breach (e.g., Third-party, Misconfiguration, Hacked...).

Each data point in the dataset provides a wealth of information to support in-depth analysis and model building.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the frequency, distribution, and trends in cyber incidents over time.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualize patterns in cyber incidents based on organization type, breach method, and records affected.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build predictive models to analyze potential risk factors or impact.
4. **Recommendations**: Suggest actionable insights for stakeholders based on analysis results.

## Repository Structure üìÅ
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed versions of the cyber incident dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **cleaning/**: Python scripts for data processing, visualization, and model training.
- **README.md**: Project overview, objectives, and instructions (this file).
- **requirements.txt**: Dependencies for the project.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marielouisehanna/Data_science_Crime_Project.git
   cd Data_science_Crime_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Install project dependencies:
